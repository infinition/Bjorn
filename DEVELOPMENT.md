#### Scan Results

Located in `data/output/scan_results/`.
This file is generated everytime the network is scanned. It is used to consolidate the data and update netkb.

**Example:**

![Scan result](https://github.com/infinition/Bjorn/assets/37984399/eb4a313a-f90c-4c43-b699-3678271886dc)

## 📖 Detailed Project Description

### 👀 Behavior of Bjorn

Once launched, Bjorn performs the following steps:

1. **Initialization**: Loads configuration, initializes shared data, and sets up necessary components such as the e-Paper HAT display.
2. **Network Scanning**: Scans the network to identify live hosts and open ports. Updates the network knowledge base (`netkb`) with the results.
3. **Orchestration**: Orchestrates different actions based on the configuration and network knowledge base. This includes performing vulnerability scanning, attacks, and file stealing.
4. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Performs vulnerability scans on identified hosts and updates the vulnerability summary.
5. **Brute-Force Attacks and File Stealing**: Starts brute-force attacks and steals files based on the configuration criteria.
6. **Display Updates**: Continuously updates the e-Paper HAT display with current information such as network status, vulnerabilities, and various statistics. Bjorn also displays random comments based on different themes and statuses.

7. **Web Server**: Provides a web interface for monitoring and interacting with Bjorn.


## **Installing and Developing Bjorn from Source Quick Start**

This guide provides a streamlined process for setting up and developing Bjorn on a Raspberry Pi, starting from the assumption that you are already connected via SSH as `bjorn@bjorn.local`.

---

### ▶️ Installing Bjorn from Source

#### 📗 Prerequisites

Ensure your Raspberry Pi is up-to-date and ready for development:
```bash
# Update the system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install Git
sudo apt install git -y
```

#### 📗 Clone the Repository

Clone your fork of Bjorn from GitHub (replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username):
```bash
git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/Bjorn.git
cd Bjorn

# Create and switch to a development branch
git checkout -b dev
```

#### 🐍 Set Up Python Environment

Install Python and set up a virtual environment:
```bash
# Install Python and venv
sudo apt install python3 python3-venv python3-pip -y

# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 🎨 Configure Oh My Zsh (optional)

Install and configure **Oh My Zsh** with the Half-Life theme:
```bash
# Install Zsh
sudo apt install zsh -y

# Install Oh My Zsh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

# Use the built-in theme selection tool to set the Half-Life theme
omz theme set half-life

# Reload Zsh
exec zsh
```

#### 🛠️ Install Bjorn

Run the installation script:
```bash
sudo bash install_bjorn.sh
```

After installation, disable the Bjorn service for uninterrupted development unless testing service-related features:
```bash
# Stop and disable the Bjorn service
sudo systemctl stop bjorn.service
sudo systemctl disable bjorn.service
```

---

### ▶️ Running Bjorn for Development

### 📗 Manual Start

To run Bjorn manually (ensure the service is stopped):
```bash
cd /home/bjorn/Bjorn

# Run Bjorn
sudo python Bjorn.py
```

#### 🕹️ Service Control

Control the Bjorn service (useful for testing service restart functionality):
```bash
# Start Bjorn
sudo systemctl start bjorn.service

# Stop Bjorn
sudo systemctl stop bjorn.service

# Check status
sudo systemctl status bjorn.service

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u bjorn.service
```

#### 🪄 Fresh Start

Reset Bjorn to a clean state:
```bash
sudo rm -rf /home/bjorn/Bjorn/config/*.json \
    /home/bjorn/Bjorn/data/*.csv \
    /home/bjorn/Bjorn/data/*.log \
    /home/bjorn/Bjorn/data/output/data_stolen/* \
    /home/bjorn/Bjorn/data/output/crackedpwd/* \
    /home/bjorn/Bjorn/config/* \
    /home/bjorn/Bjorn/data/output/scan_results/* \
    /home/bjorn/Bjorn/__pycache__ \
    /home/bjorn/Bjorn/config/__pycache__ \
    /home/bjorn/Bjorn/data/__pycache__ \
    /home/bjorn/Bjorn/actions/__pycache__ \
    /home/bjorn/Bjorn/resources/__pycache__ \
    /home/bjorn/Bjorn/web/__pycache__ \
    /home/bjorn/Bjorn/*.log \
    /home/bjorn/Bjorn/resources/waveshare_epd/__pycache__ \
    /home/bjorn/Bjorn/data/logs/* \
    /home/bjorn/Bjorn/data/output/vulnerabilities/* \
    /home/bjorn/Bjorn/data/logs/*
```
Everything will be recreated automatically at the next launch of Bjorn.

### ▶️ Development Workflow

### 📗 Managing Git Branches

Ensure you are working in the `dev` branch:
```bash
# Check the current branch
git branch

# If not on the dev branch, switch to it
git checkout dev
```

Standard Git commands for managing your changes:
```bash
# Add and stage changes
git add .

# Commit changes with a meaningful message
git commit -m "Describe your changes"

# Push changes to your fork on the dev branch
git push origin dev
```

#### 📗 Activating Virtual Environment

Before development or testing, activate the virtual environment:
```bash
cd /home/bjorn/Bjorn
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

### ▶️ Checklist for Developers

1. SSH into the Raspberry Pi as `bjorn@bjorn.local`.
2. Update the system and install Git.
3. Clone the Bjorn repository and create a development branch.
4. Set up Python virtual environment and install dependencies.
5. Install and configure Oh My Zsh with the Half-Life theme.
6. Install Bjorn using `install_bjorn.sh` and disable the service.
7. Run Bjorn manually for development.
8. Ensure you’re working in the `dev` branch and use Git to manage changes.
9. Activate the virtual environment before running Bjorn or testing.

## ❇️ Important Configuration Files

### 🔗 Shared Configuration (`shared_config.json`)

Defines various settings for Bjorn, including:

- Boolean settings (`manual_mode`, `websrv`, `debug_mode`, etc.).
- Time intervals and delays.
- Network settings.
- Port lists and blacklists.
These settings are accessible on the webpage.

### 🛠️ Actions Configuration (`actions.json`)

Lists the actions to be performed by Bjorn, including (dynamically generated with the content of the folder):

- Module and class definitions.
- Port assignments.
- Parent-child relationships.
- Action status definitions.

## 📟 E-Paper Display Support

Currently, hardcoded for the 2.13-inch V2 & V4 e-Paper HAT. 
My program automatically detect the screen model and adapt the python expressions into my code.

For other versions:
- As I don't have the v1 and v3 to validate my algorithm, I just hope it will work properly.

### 🍾 Ghosting Removed!
In my journey to make Bjorn work with the different screen versions, I struggled, hacking several parameters and found out that it was possible to remove the ghosting of screens! I let you see this, I think this method will be very useful for all other projects with the e-paper screen!

## ✍️ Development Guidelines

### ➕ Adding New Actions

1. Create a new action file in `actions/`.
2. Implement required methods:
   - `__init__(self, shared_data)`
   - `execute(self, ip, port, row, status_key)`
3. Add the action to `actions.json`.
4. Follow existing action patterns.

### 🧪 Testing

1. Create a test environment.
2. Use an isolated network.
3. Follow ethical guidelines.
4. Document test cases.

## 💻 Web Interface

- **Access**: `http://[device-ip]:8000`
- **Features**:
  - Real-time monitoring with a console.
  - Configuration management.
  - Viewing results. (Credentials and files)
  - System control.

## 🧭 Project Roadmap

### 🪛 Current Focus

- Stability improvements.
- Bug fixes.
- Service reliability.
